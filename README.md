### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Anastasiy. Nice to meet you!

Sorry, can't share my cool projects from work since they're top secret, but hey, check out these open-source ones I'm involved in! Among my contributions are AUTOMATIC1111's [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) diffusion neural net/AI Art tool, [IINA](https://github.com/anastasiuspernat/iina) and [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) media players and [torch/nn](https://github.com/torch/nn) neural network package for PyTorch.
