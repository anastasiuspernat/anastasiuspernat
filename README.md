### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Anastasiy. Nice to meet you!

I'm a full stack engineer & UI designer living in San Francisco Bay Area.

Check out these opensource projects I'm involved in! (Sorry, can't share my cool projects from work since they're top secret). Among my contributions are AUTOMATIC1111's [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) diffusion neural net/AI Art tool, [IINA](https://github.com/anastasiuspernat/iina) and [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) media players and [torch/nn](https://github.com/torch/nn) neural network package for PyTorch.
